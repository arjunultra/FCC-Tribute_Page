        <h2>Here's a timeline of Mahātmā Gandhiji's life:</h2>
        <ol start="1">
          <li>
            Early Life and Education (1869-1888):
            <ul>
              <li>
                Gandhi was born to Karamchand Gandhi and Putlibai in Porbandar.
              </li>
              <li>
                He grew up in a devout Hindu family and was influenced by Jain
                philosophy and his mother's teachings.
              </li>
              <li>
                In 1888, he traveled to London to study law, where he
                encountered racism and began to develop his principles of
                justice and equality.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Experiences in South Africa (1893-1914):
            <ul>
              <li>
                Gandhi moved to South Africa to work as a lawyer, where he
                witnessed racial discrimination against Indians.
              </li>
              <li>
                He began his activism by leading campaigns against injustices,
                advocating for the rights of Indians, and launching his
                philosophy of nonviolent resistance, "Satyagraha."
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Return to India (1915-1919):
            <ul>
              <li>
                Gandhi returned to India and joined the Indian National Congress
                in its struggle for independence from British rule.
              </li>
              <li>
                He organized various protests, strikes, and marches, advocating
                for civil rights and self-reliance.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 and the subsequent harsh
                British measures led to widespread protests and marked a turning
                point in India's fight for freedom.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922):
            <ul>
              <li>
                Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation Movement, urging Indians to
                boycott British goods, institutions, and symbols.
              </li>
              <li>
                Millions of Indians participated, showcasing their commitment to
                nonviolence and civil disobedience.
              </li>
              <li>
                The movement was suspended after incidents of violence, but it
                had a profound impact on India's political landscape.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Salt March and Civil Disobedience (1930-1934):
            <ul>
              <li>
                Gandhi led the historic Salt March in 1930, a 240-mile protest
                against the British monopoly on salt production and sales.
              </li>
              <li>
                The march gained international attention and fueled the civil
                disobedience movement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Despite imprisonment and hardships, Gandhi's philosophy of
                nonviolence continued to inspire millions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
